This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

NodeJS and TailwindCSS need to be installed for this app.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Note the buttons to change pages only work if you click on the text (I couldn't work out how to get the whole button to be the link).


## Assumptions and Decisions

I assumed that the pokemon to be displayed on each page was at my discretion so I did it by generation according to List of Pokemon on Wikipedia.
I also assumed that the styling with TailwindCSS was again at my discretion so I used some different colours and hover animations to try out different things and try and neaten up parts of the pages.
